It is important to understand the context in which certain terms are used:</p>\n<ul>\n    <li><b>Brahmin/Brahminism:</b> Refers to the brahmin caste and the ideology associated with brahminical social order.</li>\n    <li><b>Savarna:</b> Refers to the upper castes in the Hindu social hierarchy.</li>\n    <li><b>Dalit:</b> Refers to the historically marginalized communities formerly known as \"untouchables.\"</li>\n    <li><b>OBC:</b> Refers to Other Backward Classes, a collection of castes recognized as socially and educationally disadvantaged.</li>\n    <li><b>SC/ST:</b> Refers to Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes, communities officially recognized as historically disadvantaged and entitled to certain protections and reservations.</li>\n</ul>\n\n\n  <h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction</h2>\n  <p>India, a land of diverse cultures and traditions, grapples with the persistent issue of caste discrimination. Despite constitutional guarantees of equality, the deeply entrenched caste system continues to influence various aspects of life, including access to justice. Recent court decisions concerning <b>casteism</b> reflect the ongoing struggle to address this complex problem and uphold the principles of equality and fairness.</p>\n\n  <h2 id=\"fir-caste\">Caste in FIRs: An Unnecessary Detail?</h2>\n  <p>One of the critical issues under judicial scrutiny is the practice of mentioning the caste of the accused in First Information Reports (FIRs). The Allahabad High Court recently questioned the Director General of Police (DGP) of Uttar Pradesh about the rationale behind this practice. The court sought clarification on whether there was a valid reason for including the caste of the accused in FIRs and official documents. The concern is that such a practice could be prejudicial and hinder justice, especially for marginalized communities. [insert image here -77.64]</p>\n\n  <h3 id=\"sc-objection\">Supreme Court's Objection to Caste Mention</h3>\n  <p>This concern echoes a previous observation by the Supreme Court in March 2023. The apex court expressed its disapproval of mentioning the caste of accused individuals in court case titles. Citing an Indian Express report, the Supreme Court emphasized that this practice should be discouraged and advised trial courts against including caste details in their judgments. [insert image here -230.28]</p>\n\n  <h3 id=\"state-responses\">State Government Responses</h3>\n  <p>Following the Supreme Court's stance, several state governments took note and responded positively. The Haryana government, through its High Court, directed the state police to refrain from mentioning caste or religion in FIRs. Subsequently, the Director General of Police of Haryana submitted an affidavit to the High Court, assuring compliance with the directive. Similarly, the Madhya Pradesh police also announced that they would discontinue the practice of mentioning caste in FIRs. [insert image here -317.8]</p>\n\n  <h3 id=\"up-situation\">The Situation in Uttar Pradesh</h3>\n  <p>However, Uttar Pradesh presents a contrasting scenario. Despite the Supreme Court's guidance and the actions of other states, the Uttar Pradesh police continued to include the caste of the accused in FIRs. This prompted the Allahabad High Court to intervene and question the DGP about the justification for this practice. It's noteworthy that a 2019 article in Aaj Tak highlighted the disproportionate representation of certain castes in Uttar Pradesh's police force, with a significant number of police station in-charges belonging to the Thakur or Brahmin communities. [insert image here -381.24]This raises concerns about potential bias and its impact on the fairness of investigations.</p>\n\n  <h2 id=\"temple-ownership\">Temple Ownership: Can Caste Be a Basis for Claim?</h2>\n  <p>Another significant legal development is the Madras High Court's ruling on temple ownership. The court unequivocally stated that no individual or group can claim ownership of a temple based solely on their caste. This landmark decision challenges the traditional caste-based claims to temple administration and guardianship. [insert image here -1773.44]</p>\n\n  <h3 id=\"madras-hc-ruling\">Madras High Court's Ruling</h3>\n  <p>Justice Bharath Chakravarthy asserted that temples are public institutions open to all devotees, regardless of caste. The court emphasized that caste-based claims to temple administration are not protected religious practices under the Indian Constitution. The ruling underscored the importance of inclusivity and equal access to religious institutions for all.</p>\n\n  <h3 id=\"religious-sect\">Caste vs. Religious Sect</h3>\n  <p>The court clarified the distinction between caste and a religious denomination. While acknowledging that certain social groups may have traditional worship practices, it asserted that caste itself does not constitute a protected religious denomination. This distinction is crucial in preventing caste-based discrimination and ensuring equal access to religious institutions.</p>\n\n  <h3 id=\"constitution-protection\">Constitutional Protection of Religious Practices</h3>\n  <p>The Madras High Court acknowledged that the Indian Constitution, specifically Articles 25 and 26, safeguards the rights of religious denominations and protects their practices. However, it emphasized that these protections do not extend to caste-based claims of temple administration. The court cautioned against using religious affiliation to perpetuate caste-based inequality and division.</p>\n\n  <h2 id=\"caste-slurs\">Caste-Based Slurs: Are They Always Illegal?</h2>\n  <p>A recent Supreme Court decision has sparked controversy regarding the legality of using caste-based slurs. The court ruled that using terms like \"Miya,\" \"Mulla,\" or \"Pakistani\" may be unseemly but does not necessarily constitute a criminal offense under Section 298 of the Indian Penal Code (IPC). [insert image here -2131.119]</p>\n\n  <h3 id=\"sc-ruling-mia\">Supreme Court's Ruling on 'Miya'</h3>\n  <p>The Supreme Court, in the case of Harinandan Singh vs. Jharkhand, stated that using derogatory terms like \"Miya,\" \"Tiya,\" or \"Pakistani\" towards an individual might be offensive but does not automatically qualify as a crime under Section 298 of the IPC. The bench, comprising Justices Nagaratna and Satish Chandra Sharma, quashed a case against a government employee accused of using the term \"Pakistani\" while on duty.</p>\n\n  <h3 id=\"section-298\">Section 298 of the Indian Penal Code</h3>\n  <p>Section 298 of the IPC deals with offenses related to deliberately hurting religious sentiments. The Supreme Court's interpretation suggests that using caste-based slurs does not automatically fall under this section. This ruling raises concerns about the potential for misuse and the protection of marginalized communities against caste-based abuse.</p>\n\n  <h3 id=\"implications-other-castes\">Implications for Other Castes</h3>\n  <p>This ruling has sparked debate about its potential implications for other castes. The question arises whether similar leniency would be extended to individuals using derogatory terms against members of other castes, particularly those historically marginalized. The decision raises concerns about potential double standards and the need for a consistent approach to addressing caste-based discrimination.</p>\n\n  <h2 id=\"police-system\">The Caste Composition of the Police System</h2>\n  <p>Understanding the pervasive nature of caste requires examining its presence in institutions like the police. As mentioned earlier, a 2019 report highlighted the disproportionate representation of certain castes, particularly Thakurs and Brahmins, in positions of authority within Uttar Pradesh's police force. This raises concerns about potential bias in investigations and law enforcement practices. [insert image here -402.44] The concentration of power within specific caste groups can create an environment where discriminatory practices are more likely to occur, hindering the delivery of impartial justice.</p>\n\n  <h2 id=\"judiciary-caste\">Caste Dynamics in the Judiciary</h2>\n  <p>The judiciary, as the guardian of justice, is not immune to the influences of caste. Examining the caste composition of the judiciary reveals significant disparities and raises questions about representation and fairness.</p>\n\n  <h3 id=\"cji-brahmin\">Chief Justices of India and Caste</h3>\n  <p>Data reveals a historical dominance of certain castes in the highest judicial positions. According to a Bar and Bench article, out of the 47 Chief Justices of India (CJIs) until 2021, 14 were Brahmins. The article further projected that by the time the 50th CJI assumes office, the number of Brahmin CJIs would reach 16. [insert image here -611.6] This over-representation raises concerns about the diversity and inclusivity of the judiciary's leadership.</p>\n\n  <h3 id=\"dalit-judges\">Representation of Dalit Judges</h3>\n  <p>In contrast to the over-representation of certain castes, the representation of marginalized communities in the judiciary has been historically lacking. The Bar and Bench article noted that until 2021, there were no judges from the Scheduled Castes (SC) or Scheduled Tribes (ST) communities in the Supreme Court. While this situation has improved with the appointment of Dalit judges, the historical under-representation underscores the systemic barriers faced by marginalized communities in accessing the higher echelons of the judiciary. A 2024 NDTV article highlights that, for the first time, the Supreme Court will have three Dalit judges. [insert image here -645.88]</p>\n\n  <h3 id=\"hc-judges\">High Court Judges and Caste</h3>\n  <p>The under-representation of marginalized communities extends to the High Courts as well. A 2023 article by The Wire, referencing information provided by the then-Union Law Minister Arjun Ram Meghwal in Parliament, revealed that a significant majority of High Court judges appointed in the preceding five years belonged to upper castes. [insert image here -700.72] JanSatta reported that 79% of High Court judges appointed in those five years were from upper castes, while Scheduled Castes and minorities accounted for a mere 2% of the appointments. The dominance of upper castes in the High Courts raises concerns about potential biases and the fair representation of diverse perspectives in judicial decision-making.</p>\n\n  <h2 id=\"prison-stats\">Caste and Religion in Prisons: A Grim Reality</h2>\n  <p>The inequalities of the caste system are starkly reflected in the demographics of India's prison population. Data reveals a disproportionate representation of marginalized communities, particularly Scheduled Castes, Scheduled Tribes, and Other Backward Classes, in prisons. This raises concerns about systemic bias in law enforcement and the justice system.</p>\n\n  <h3 id=\"undertrial-prisoners\">The Plight of Undertrial Prisoners</h3>\n  <p>Adding to the grim picture, a significant percentage of prisoners in India are undertrials, meaning they are awaiting trial and have not been convicted of any crime. A BBC report from 2022 indicates that approximately 70% of prisoners in India are undertrials. [insert image here -851.12] This situation highlights the issue of prolonged detention without due process and the potential for innocent individuals to languish in prison for extended periods.</p>\n\n  <h3 id=\"inhuman-conditions\">Inhuman Prison Conditions</h3>\n  <p>Overcrowding and poor conditions exacerbate the plight of prisoners in India. Reports indicate that prisons often operate at significantly overcapacity, with some facilities housing double or triple the number of inmates they were designed for. This leads to unsanitary conditions, inadequate healthcare, and increased stress levels, further marginalizing vulnerable populations. Data indicates that, on average, prisons house 130 inmates for every 100 they are designed to hold; in some instances, this number exceeds 200 or even 300. [insert image here -901.24]</p>\n\n   <h3 id=\"caste-prision-work\">Caste Based Work in Prisions</h3>\n\t<p>The discrimination doesn't end once an individual is incarcerated. A deeply disturbing aspect of the Indian prison system is the prevalence of caste-based labor. A report by Sukanya Shantha highlighted the practice of assigning work based on caste, with upper-caste prisoners often assigned to tasks like cooking and accounting, while lower-caste prisoners are relegated to menial and degrading jobs such as cleaning toilets and sewers. [insert image here -1077.32] This blatant discrimination perpetuates the caste hierarchy within the prison system.</p>\n\n  <h2 id=\"caste-bias\">The Systemic Caste Bias in Justice Delivery</h2>\n  <p>The disproportionate representation of marginalized communities in prisons, coupled with reports of caste-based discrimination within the system, points to a systemic bias in the delivery of justice. The combination of a police force dominated by certain castes, a judiciary with limited representation from marginalized communities, and discriminatory practices within prisons creates a system where justice is not equally accessible or fairly administered to all.</p>\n<p>Supreme Court's response, while well-intentioned, highlights the complexity of addressing caste-based discrimination within the existing system. The court issued directives to eliminate caste-based work assignments in prisons, including removing caste columns from prison rosters. [insert image here -1092.52] However, the effectiveness of these directives remains uncertain, as their implementation and impact have yet to be fully evaluated.</p>\n  \n\n  <h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n  <p>The recent court decisions and the realities they expose underscore the persistent challenges in dismantling the caste system in India. While legal pronouncements and government initiatives aim to address caste-based discrimination, systemic biases and deeply entrenched social attitudes continue to pose significant obstacles. Addressing this complex issue requires a multi-pronged approach that includes promoting greater representation of marginalized communities in the judiciary and law enforcement, dismantling discriminatory practices within the prison system, and fostering a society that embraces inclusivity and equality. It is crucial to continue scrutinizing legal frameworks, challenging discriminatory practices, and advocating for social justice to create a truly equitable society where caste is no longer a determinant of opportunity or outcome.</p>\n<p><b>Call to action:</b> Share this article and spread awareness about the complexities of casteism and the role of the judiciary.
