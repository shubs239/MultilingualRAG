  <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
  <p>
   Prayag, known in modern times as Allahabad and recently renamed Prayagraj, holds a significant place in Indian history and spirituality. While often associated with the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and Saraswati rivers (Triveni Sangam) and Hindu religious practices, a lesser-known aspect of Prayag's past is its rich Buddhist heritage. This article aims to explore the evidence that suggests Prayag was once a prominent center of Buddhism, challenging the predominantly Brahminical narratives that have shaped its historical identity. By examining historical records, traveler accounts, and archaeological findings, we can begin to unveil the hidden Buddhist history of <b>Prayag</b>.
  </p>
  <h2 id="traveler-accounts">Traveler Accounts: Glimpses of Buddhist Prayag</h2>
  <p>
   One of the primary sources for understanding Prayag's Buddhist past is the accounts of ancient travelers who visited the region. These accounts offer valuable insights into the religious landscape of the time and provide glimpses of the Buddhist presence in Prayag. We will focus on the records of two prominent travelers:
  </p>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Ven Sang:</b> A Chinese Buddhist monk who traveled to India in the 7th century CE, documented his experiences in detail, providing valuable information about the religious and cultural practices of the regions he visited.</li>
   <li><b>Alexander Cunningham:</b> A British archaeologist and historian who played a crucial role in the study of ancient Indian history. His work, including his translations and interpretations of ancient texts, sheds light on Prayag's Buddhist past.
   </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
   These accounts, when carefully analyzed, reveal a different picture of Prayag â€“ one where Buddhism thrived and played a significant role in the region's identity.
  </p>
  <h2 id="alexander-cunningham">Alexander Cunningham's Insights</h2>
  <p>
   Alexander Cunningham's work is instrumental in understanding the historical context of Prayag. He meticulously analyzed ancient texts and traveler accounts, including those of Ven Sang, to piece together a more accurate picture of the region's past. Cunningham's insights challenge the prevailing narratives and provide valuable evidence of Prayag's Buddhist connections.
  </p>
  <h3 id="cunningham-on-name-change">Cunningham on the Name Change</h3>
  <p>
   Cunningham notes the historical significance of Prayag, predating its later renaming as Allahabad. He points out that the name "Prayag" was already in use centuries before the Mughal emperor Akbar established the fort and subsequently, his grandson Shah Jahan renamed the city to Allahabad [insert image here - 138]. This renaming, according to Cunningham, occurred in the 17th century, much later than the period when Ven Sang visited the region.
  </p>
  <h3 id="ven-sang-visit">Ven Sang's Visit</h3>
  <p>
   Cunningham highlights Ven Sang's travels through India in the 7th century CE, during which he visited Prayag. Ven Sang's account provides crucial evidence of the region's Buddhist affiliations. Cunningham emphasizes that Ven Sang's visit predates the Mughal influence, indicating that Prayag was already known by its ancient name and had a significant Buddhist presence long before the arrival of Islam in the region [insert image here - 156].
  </p>
  <h3 id="akbar-fort">Akbar's Fort</h3>
  <p>
   Cunningham acknowledges the construction of the Allahabad Fort by Akbar during the Mughal era. However, he clarifies that the fort's construction did not erase the region's Buddhist past. Instead, Cunningham suggests that the fort was built on a site that already had Buddhist associations, further emphasizing the region's pre-Islamic Buddhist heritage. He notes that Buddhist kings and monasteries were present, offering "daan" (donations), a tradition that occurred centuries earlier.
  </p>
  <h2 id="brahminical-narratives">Challenging Brahminical Narratives</h2>
  <p>
   Despite the historical evidence supporting Prayag's Buddhist past, Brahminical narratives have often dominated the region's historical identity. These narratives, according to Cunningham, have obscured the Buddhist influence and promoted a different version of history that emphasizes Brahminical traditions and beliefs.
  </p>
  <h3 id="origin-of-prayag-name">The Origin of the Name "Prayag"</h3>
  <p>
   Cunningham challenges the Brahminical story about the origin of the name "Prayag." According to this story, the name is derived from a Brahmin who sacrificed himself during the construction of Akbar's fort. Cunningham dismisses this story as a fabrication, pointing out that it was likely created during the British period to legitimize Brahminical claims over the region [insert image here - 231].
  </p>
  <h3 id="akshayavat-tree">The Akshayavat Tree</h3>
  <p>
   Cunningham also questions the Brahminical significance attributed to the Akshayavat tree, a sacred fig tree located within the Allahabad Fort. He suggests that the tree's association with Brahminical rituals and beliefs was likely a later development, obscuring its possible Buddhist origins. Cunningham notes that the Brahmins told stories to the pilgrims who came to see the Akshayavat tree [insert image here - 355].
  </p>
  <h3 id="cunningham-skepticism">Cunningham's Skepticism</h3>
  <p>
   Cunningham expresses skepticism towards the local traditions and stories surrounding Prayag, particularly those promoted by Brahmins. He urges caution in accepting these narratives, suggesting that they are often biased and unreliable. Instead, Cunningham emphasizes the importance of relying on verifiable historical records and archaeological evidence to reconstruct the true history of the region.
  </p>
  <h2 id="deciphering-wen-sang">Deciphering Wen Sang: Buddhist Context</h2>
  <p>
   To understand Ven Sang's account accurately, it is crucial to interpret it within its proper Buddhist context. This involves understanding the terminology used, the religious practices described, and the overall cultural landscape of the time.
  </p>
  <h3 id="two-sangharamas">Two Sangharamas</h3>
  <p>
   Ven Sang mentions the presence of two Sangharamas (Buddhist monasteries) in Prayag, inhabited by monks of the Hinayana (Theravada) school of Buddhism. He also refers to several Deva temples, which he describes as being occupied by opponents of the Buddhist Sangha [insert image here - 1142]. It's important to recognize here that the opponents of the Buddhist Sangha were not necessarily followers of Vedic Brahmanism but could have been members of other Buddhist sects or heterodoxical Shraman traditions. The term "Brahmin," as used in some translations, can be misleading and should not be interpreted as referring to the modern-day Brahmin caste or Vedic traditions.
  </p>
  <h3 id="ashoka-stupa">Ashoka's Stupa</h3>
  <p>
   Ven Sang notes the existence of a large stupa built by Emperor Ashoka to the southwest of the capital, in a Champak forest. He further mentions that this was the spot where Buddha defeated his opponents.
  </p>
  <h3 id="bodhisattva-dev">Bodhisattva's Defense</h3>
  <p>
   Ven Sang mentions that Dev Bodhisattva resided in Sangharama and gave replies to those opponents [insert image here - 1466]. This reference highlights the presence of learned Buddhist scholars and monks in Prayag, who were actively engaged in defending Buddhist doctrines and practices against opposing views.
  </p>
  <h2 id="the-akshayavat">The Akshayavat Tree: A Buddhist Relic?</h2>
  <p>
   The Akshayavat tree, a sacred fig tree located within the Allahabad Fort, is a site of great religious significance in Prayag. While Brahminical traditions associate the tree with their own beliefs and rituals, there is a possibility that the Akshayavat tree may have had Buddhist origins.
  </p>
  <h3 id="pilgrim-tree">Pilgrim Tree</h3>
  <p>
   As Alexander Cunningham said, the Nirgrantha tree was used by the pilgirm people who do suicide there.
  </p>
  <h3 id="pilgrim-meaning">Pilgrim Meaning</h3>
  <p>
   Cunningham notes that the temple was translated from pilgrim, which means pilgirm site.
  </p>
  <h3 id="pilgrim-temple">Pilgrim Temple</h3>
  <p>
   Cunningham acknowledges that Ashok stupa are beside pilgrim temple, which points to Mahayana Pilgrim location.
  </p>
  <h2 id="the-power-of-stories">The Power of Stories and the Suppression of Truth</h2>
  <p>
   The discussion also underscores the power of stories and narratives in shaping historical understanding. The dominant Brahminical narratives, often presented as unquestionable truths, have obscured the Buddhist past of Prayag and other regions of India.
  </p>
  <h3 id="challenging-fabrications">Challenging Brahminical Fabrications</h3>
  <p>
   The transcript challenges the Brahminical stories and myths that have been used to legitimize their claims over Prayag and other sites.
  </p>
  <h3 id="mothers-creadit">Mother's Credit</h3>
  <p>
   The user challenges those, who can't credit their birth to their mother, because of Brahminical stories.
  </p>
  <h3 id="fake-news">Fake News</h3>
  <p>
   The user says, every story of Brahmin is fake and that their fake news propagates.
  </p>

  </p>
  <h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
   The exploration of Prayag's history reveals a complex interplay of religious influences and narratives. While Brahminical traditions have long dominated the region's historical identity, a closer examination of historical records, traveler accounts, and archaeological evidence suggests a significant Buddhist presence in Prayag's past.
  </p>
  <p>
   By challenging the prevailing narratives and reclaiming the true heritage of Prayag, we can foster a more inclusive and accurate understanding of India's rich and diverse history. It is crucial to approach historical research with a critical eye, questioning dominant narratives and seeking out alternative perspectives. Further research and archaeological investigations are needed to uncover more evidence of Prayag's Buddhist past and to challenge the narratives that have obscured this important aspect of its history.
