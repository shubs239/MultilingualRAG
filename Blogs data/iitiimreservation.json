Recent data reveals a concerning reality: despite mandatory <b>reservation</b> policies, these institutions continue to be dominated by individuals from general categories, raising questions about systemic biases and the need for affirmative action. Are these institutions truly reflecting the diversity of India, or are we perpetuating historical inequalities? Therefore, this article aims to explore the current state of <b>reservation</b> in IITs and IIMs, examine the underlying issues, and propose potential solutions to ensure equitable access and representation for all sections of society.</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"historical-context\">The Historical Context of Reservation in India</h2>\n    <p>The concept of <b>reservation</b> in India is deeply rooted in the country's history of caste-based discrimination. For centuries, marginalized communities, particularly Scheduled Castes (SCs), Scheduled Tribes (STs), and Other Backward Classes (OBCs), were denied access to education, employment, and other opportunities due to their social status. To address these historical injustices, the Indian Constitution enshrined the principle of <b>reservation</b>, providing quotas for these communities in government jobs and educational institutions.</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"brahmanical-control\">The Brahmanical Control of Education</h2>\n    <p>It is crucial to recognize that the \"Brahmanical system\" has historically exerted significant control over education in India. The term \"Brahmanical system\" implies a system that reinforces caste hierarchies and dominance, with Brahmins traditionally holding the highest social status. This control, even after independence, has been used to subtly undermine the rights and opportunities of Bahujan students. \"Bahujan\" refers to communities including Scheduled Castes (SC), Scheduled Tribes (ST), and Other Backward Classes (OBC) who have historically faced social and economic discrimination. Despite constitutional guarantees and <b>reservation</b> policies designed to level the playing field, elites have strategically employed maneuvers to maintain dominance in the education sector. This control reinforces existing social hierarchies and limits the progress of marginalized communities ([insert image here - 185.159]).</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"iit-iim-reservation\">Reservation Realities in IITs and IIMs</h2>\n    <p>IITs and IIMs are considered premier institutions for higher education in India. Admission to these institutions is highly competitive, and graduates often go on to hold positions of influence in various fields. Therefore, ensuring representation from all sections of society in these institutions is crucial for promoting inclusivity and social justice. However, data suggests that the reality on the ground is far from ideal.</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"faculty-representation\">Disparities in Faculty Representation</h2>\n    <p>One of the most glaring issues is the under-representation of SCs, STs, and OBCs in faculty positions at IITs and IIMs. Despite <b>reservation</b> policies, the vast majority of faculty members belong to general categories. This disparity raises concerns about the diversity of perspectives in teaching and research and the potential for bias in the evaluation of students from marginalized communities ([insert image here - 244.959]).</p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"iim-indore\">IIM Indore: A Case Study</h3>\n    <p>A report highlighted that IIM Indore had an astounding 97% of its faculty from the general category, with no representation from SC/ST communities. This stark statistic exemplifies the systemic barriers that prevent marginalized communities from accessing faculty positions in these institutions ([insert image here - 1328.12]).</p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"iit-bombay-kharagpur\">IIT Bombay and Kharagpur: A Similar Story</h3>\n    <p>Similarly, IIT Bombay and Kharagpur reported that 90% of their teachers belonged to the general category. These figures indicate that the problem is not isolated to a few institutions but rather a widespread phenomenon across IITs and IIMs ([insert image here - 1430.639]).</p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"rti-revelations\">RTI Revelations: The Extent of the Imbalance</h3>\n    <p>An RTI filed by an OBC student revealed that at least two IITs and three IIMs have over 90% of their faculty positions filled by individuals from the general category. Furthermore, six IITs and four IIMs have between 80% and 90% of their faculty from the same category, exposing a significant imbalance in representation ([insert image here - 1280.04]).</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"student-dropout\">The Plight of Marginalized Students: Dropouts and Discrimination</h2>\n    <p>Besides faculty representation, data also indicates a concerning trend of students from marginalized communities dropping out of IITs and IIMs. A study revealed that over 13,000 SC, ST, and OBC students left central universities, including IITs and IIMs, between 2018 and 2023. This alarming figure raises questions about the support systems available to these students and the potential for discrimination within these institutions ([insert image here - 1815.48]).</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"institutional-discrimination\">Institutional Discrimination and Mental Health</h2>\n    <p>Reports have also highlighted the prevalence of caste-based discrimination within IITs and IIMs, leading to mental health issues among marginalized students. Students have reported facing harassment, discrimination, and a hostile environment that makes it difficult for them to thrive. In some cases, this discrimination has led to tragic consequences, with students taking their own lives ([insert image here - 2173.76]).</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"data-disappearance\">The Disappearance of Reservation Data</h2>\n    <p>Adding to the opacity surrounding <b>reservation</b> policies, it has been observed that the Department of Personnel and Training (DoPT) has removed <b>reservation</b> data from its annual reports. This lack of transparency makes it challenging to assess the effectiveness of <b>reservation</b> policies and hold institutions accountable for their implementation. This lack of transparency further complicates the situation, raising concerns about other potential challenges to <b>reservation</b> policies, such as the recent developments in Kashmir ([insert image here - 2696.2]).</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"kashmir-reservation\">The Kashmir Conundrum: Opposition to Reservation After Article 370</h2>\n    <p>Following the abrogation of Article 370 in Jammu and Kashmir, a peculiar phenomenon has emerged: opposition to <b>reservation</b> policies. Surprisingly, both Brahmins and Muslims in the region have united to protest against <b>reservation</b>, demanding appointments based on merit. This opposition raises questions about the future of <b>reservation</b> for marginalized communities in Kashmir and the potential for these policies to be diluted or dismantled. It also underscores how the removal of Article 370 has seemingly provided an opportunity for privileged groups to challenge affirmative action policies aimed at uplifting disadvantaged communities. The abrogation of Article 370 has seemingly changed the psychology of Savarnas towards reservation. \"Savarna\" refers to individuals belonging to the upper castes in the traditional Hindu caste hierarchy ([insert image here - 3764.96]).</p>\n        \n        <h3 id=\"brahmin-muslim-unity\">Collaboration Against Reservation</h3>\n        <p>Contrary to the common narrative of Hindu-Muslim conflict, Brahmins and Muslims in Kashmir have found common ground in opposing <b>reservation</b> policies. This unusual collaboration highlights the shared interests of privileged groups in maintaining their dominance and resisting efforts to create a more equitable society.</p>\n        \n        <h3 id=\"calls-for-merit\">Calls for Merit-Based Appointments</h3>\n        <p>Proponents of merit-based appointments argue that <b>reservation</b> undermines efficiency and quality, advocating for the selection of candidates based solely on their qualifications. However, critics argue that this perspective ignores the historical injustices and systemic barriers that prevent marginalized communities from competing on an equal footing.</p>\n        \n        <h3 id=\"concerns-over-open-merit\">Concerns Over Open Merit Candidates</h3>\n        <p>Some argue that current <b>reservation</b> policies unfairly disadvantage open merit candidates, leading to frustration and resentment. However, this argument fails to acknowledge the historical disadvantages faced by marginalized communities and the need for affirmative action to level the playing field.</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"psychology-of-savarnas\">Understanding the Psychology: Why Savarnas Feel Discriminated Against by Reservation?</h2>\n    <p>To comprehend why many Savarnas (upper-caste individuals) believe <b>reservation</b> discriminates against them, it is essential to understand the psychology of privilege. When a group has enjoyed advantages and preferential treatment for centuries, equality can feel like discrimination. Imagine someone who has always driven on a wide-open highway suddenly being asked to share the road. The feeling of losing that exclusive advantage can feel unfair, even if it’s about creating a more equitable system. Savarnas, accustomed to having an edge in education and employment, may perceive <b>reservation</b> as an unfair disadvantage that undermines their merit. The Brahmanical system has historically promoted a sense of superiority and entitlement among upper castes, making it difficult for them to accept the idea of equal opportunity for all ([insert image here - 4629.04]).</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"solutions-inclusion\">Solutions for Inclusion</h2>\n    <p>Addressing caste-based discrimination in IITs and IIMs requires a multi-pronged approach that includes:</p>\n    <ul>\n        <li><b>Increased Representation:</b> Implementing measures to ensure that SCs, STs, and OBCs are adequately represented in faculty and leadership positions.</li>\n        <li><b>Support Systems:</b> Providing comprehensive support systems for marginalized students, including academic mentoring, financial aid, and mental health services.</li>\n        <li><b>Awareness Programs:</b> Conducting awareness programs to sensitize faculty and students about caste-based discrimination and promote inclusivity.</li>\n        <li><b>Transparency:</b> Ensuring transparency in the implementation of <b>reservation</b> policies and holding institutions accountable for their effectiveness.</li>\n        <li><b>Addressing Systemic Biases:</b> Reviewing admission and evaluation processes to identify and eliminate systemic biases that may disadvantage students from marginalized communities.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <p><b>Disclaimer:</b></p>\n    <ul>\n        <li><b>Brahmin/Brahmanical:</b> In this context, the terms refer to the Brahmanical ideology, a social and political system associated with the historical dominance of the Brahmin caste.</li>\n        <li><b>Savarna:</b> Refers to individuals belonging to the upper castes in the traditional Hindu caste hierarchy.</li>\n        <li><b>Bahujan:</b> Refers to the majority population consisting of SCs, STs, and OBCs, who have historically faced social and economic marginalization.</li>\n    </ul>\n\n    <h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n    <p>The issue of <b>IIT IIM Reservation</b> and caste discrimination in IITs and IIMs is a complex challenge that requires sustained effort and commitment from all stakeholders. By acknowledging the realities of caste-based disparities, implementing effective affirmative action measures, and promoting a culture of inclusivity, these institutions can pave the way for a more equitable and just society.
