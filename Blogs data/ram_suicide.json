Similarly, the बहुजन समाज (Bahujan Samaj - meaning 'majority community') often expresses the feeling of not being united. The core of the issue lies in the persistent propagation of certain ideas, regardless of whether one identifies as Hindu, बहुजन, or a मूल निवासी (original inhabitant). This article delves into the core reasons behind this disunity, presenting a fact-based analysis.</p>\n\n    <p><b>Table of Contents</b></p>\n    <ol>\n        <li><a href=\"#introduction\">Introduction</a></li>\n        <li><a href=\"#the-role-of-ideology-in-national-unity\">The Role of Ideology in National Unity</a>\n            <ul>\n                <li><a href=\"#the-dominance-of-a-particular-ideology\">The Dominance of a Particular Ideology</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"#the-consequences-of-a-narrow-ideology\">The Consequences of a Narrow Ideology</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"#the-impact-of-mythological-figures\">The Impact of Mythological Figures</a></li>\n            </ul>\n        </li>\n        <li><a href=\"#the-claim-of-ancient-heritage-and-its-challenges\">The Claim of Ancient Heritage and Its Challenges</a>\n            <ul>\n                <li><a href=\"#challenges-to-the-claim\">Challenges to the Claim</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"#the-narrative-of-purity-and-contamination\">The Narrative of Purity and Contamination</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"#the-issue-of-purity-and-contamination\">The Issue of Purity and Contamination</a></li>\n            </ul>\n        </li>\n        <li><a href=\"#analyzing-the-ramayana-and-its-interpretations\">Analyzing the Ramayana and Its Interpretations</a>\n            <ul>\n                <li><a href=\"#the-manipulation-of-the-ramayana\">The Manipulation of the Ramayana</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"#the-character-of-ram-and-his-actions\">The Character of Ram and His Actions</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"#the-consequences-of-this-ideology\">The Consequences of this Ideology</a></li>\n            </ul>\n        </li>\n        <li><a href=\"#the-rejection-of-criticism-and-its-impact\">The Rejection of Criticism and Its Impact</a>\n            <ul>\n                <li><a href=\"#the-importance-of-accepting-criticism\">The Importance of Accepting Criticism</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"#ram-s-rejection-of-criticism\">Ram's Rejection of Criticism</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"#the-consequences-of-this-attitude\">The Consequences of this Attitude</a></li>\n            </ul>\n        </li>\n        <li><a href=\"#the-brotherhood-and-its-consequences\">The Brotherhood and Its Consequences</a>\n            <ul>\n                <li><a href=\"#the-promotion-of-brotherhood\">The Promotion of Brotherhood</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"#the-role-of-the-brahmanical-system\">The Role of the Brahmanical System</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"#the-implications-for-the-masses\">The Implications for the Masses</a></li>\n            </ul>\n        </li>\n        <li><a href=\"#the-historical-perspective-on-violence-and-its-effects\">The Historical Perspective on Violence and Its Effects</a>\n            <ul>\n                <li><a href=\"#the-prevalence-of-violence\">The Prevalence of Violence</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"#the-impact-of-this-ideology\">The Impact of this Ideology</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"#the-role-of-the-brahmanical-system-and-its-impact\">The Role of the Brahmanical System and Its Impact</a></li>\n            </ul>\n        </li>\n        <li><a href=\"#re-evaluating-ideologies-for-a-unified-future\">Re-evaluating Ideologies for a Unified Future</a>\n            <ul>\n                <li><a href=\"#the-need-for-critical-examination\">The Need for Critical Examination</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"#embracing-different-ideologies\">Embracing Different Ideologies</a></li>\n                <li><a href=\"#the-path-to-unity\">The Path to Unity</a></li>\n            </ul>\n        </li>\n        <li><a href=\"#conclusion-what-you-can-do\">Conclusion: What You Can Do?</a></li>\n        <li><a href=\"#disclaimer\">Disclaimer</a></li>\n    </ol>\n\n    <h2 id=\"introduction\">Introduction: The Role of Ideology in Indian Disunity</h2>\n    <p>The creation of unity in any country is primarily rooted in ideology. In India, the persistent propagation of certain ideologies, such as the frequent chanting of \"Jai Shri Ram,\" raises critical questions about the impact on public perception and the potential for disunity. This article aims to critically analyze the role of dominant ideologies, historical narratives, and social structures in contributing to disunity within India. </p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"the-dominance-of-a-particular-ideology\">The Dominance of a Particular Ideology</h3>\n\n    <p>The prevalent ideology promotes the idea that Ram is an ideal figure. <b>Furthermore</b>, those who disagree with this narrative are often marginalized. In many communities, a singular narrative of a particular deity is being promoted, which often discourages alternative perspectives. Such an environment can hinder the development of diverse viewpoints.</p>\n\n    <p><img src=\"[insert image here - 00:01:15]\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"the-consequences-of-a-narrow-ideology\">The Consequences of a Narrow Ideology</h3>\n\n    <p>The focus on a single narrative can lead to the perception that if you don't accept the prevailing ideology, you are seen as a threat to the nation. <b>Consequently</b>, this creates internal division and hinders social cohesion. This ideology, instead of fostering peace, often creates conflict by making people enemies of each other.</p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"the-impact-of-mythological-figures\">The Impact of Mythological Figures</h3>\n\n    <p>The impact of mythological figures in instilling ideology is crucial. <b>For instance</b>, consider the character of Ram. His actions and the interpretations of the Ramayana significantly influence societal values. People tend to learn from these figures, and often wish to become like them, making the analysis of these figures crucial in understanding societal divisions.</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"the-claim-of-ancient-heritage-and-its-challenges\">The Claim of Ancient Heritage and Its Challenges</h2>\n\n    <p>There are claims about a heritage tracing back to the Treta Yuga and the tradition of Sutras and Smritis (memory-based traditions). People assert that these traditions have been passed down through generations without significant changes. <b>However</b>, this assertion is challenged by several factors.</p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"challenges-to-the-claim\">Challenges to the Claim</h3>\n\n    <p>Many people claim that the people in the country were not united, despite having many old ideologies. <b>Indeed</b>, this claim is challenged by the reality of the situation, which shows division instead of unity. <b>Moreover</b>, the story of ancient history is questioned by modern scholars, who challenge the narratives passed down through generations.</p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"the-narrative-of-purity-and-contamination\">The Narrative of Purity and Contamination</h3>\n\n    <p>The narrative often focuses on purity and contamination, where claims of mixing are made regarding books and also the claim that contamination is a reality where cultures are destroyed by others.</p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"the-issue-of-purity-and-contamination\">The Issue of Purity and Contamination</h3>\n\n    <p>The issue is that a large part of the community does not have the right to translate these books. The majority of the translators are Brahmins. <b>This means that</b> the claim of purity and non-contamination is a false claim, as the interpretation is often filtered through a specific lens.</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"analyzing-the-ramayana-and-its-interpretations\">Analyzing the Ramayana and Its Interpretations</h2>\n\n    <p>The claim is that the Uttar Kand is a later addition to the Valmiki Ramayana. When a book is written, the author writes the introduction, the main content, and the climax. The beginning of the story does not start from the middle. The Uttar Kand narrates the birth of the main character and provides the complete story. If the Uttar Kand is removed, then the epic story will not be complete.</p>\n\n    <p><img src=\"[insert image here - 00:11:28]\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"the-manipulation-of-the-ramayana\">The Manipulation of the Ramayana</h3>\n\n    <p>The way in which the Ramayana has been interpreted, especially the character of Ram, has led to division. The character of Ram and the story of the Ramayana, which is considered the most important, depicts a story, a framework.</p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"the-character-of-ram-and-his-actions\">The Character of Ram and His Actions</h3>\n\n    <p>The narrative being promoted is that Ram is an ideal person. <b>However</b>, If a person is made an idol or an ideal, the people will automatically try to emulate that character. There are many examples that Ram's actions were to be seen in the same light. There are examples of violence. The Ramayana is said to be the source of all ideologies.</p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"the-consequences-of-this-ideology\">The Consequences of this Ideology</h3>\n\n    <p>The Ramayana shows that a person would have to take all types of actions, which is the reason for the disunity in the community. The story shows that Ram abandoned his wife. He was not kind to his brother, Lakshman. The main character of the Ramayana should be seen as a symbol of the problems in the society.</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"the-rejection-of-criticism-and-its-impact\">The Rejection of Criticism and Its Impact</h2>\n\n    <p>Kabir said, \"Nindak Niyare Rakhiye, Aangan Kuti Chhavay.\" This means, if anyone is criticizing you or saying anything wrong about you, you should listen to them and see what they are saying. <b>In other words</b>, criticism is to be taken in a positive way.</p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"the-importance-of-accepting-criticism\">The Importance of Accepting Criticism</h3>\n\n    <p>Science, in this context, is a process, and the scientific way is not about rejecting. Science advances when people provide their arguments and counter-arguments are made. Science is based on answering every type of question.</p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"ram-s-rejection-of-criticism\">Ram's Rejection of Criticism</h3>\n\n    <p>In the story, Ram's character does not like criticism. In the story of the Ramayana, the character of Ram is being presented as a person who does not take into consideration what people say about others. Ram is presented as a person who rejects criticism.</p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"the-consequences-of-this-attitude\">The Consequences of this Attitude</h3>\n\n    <p>This shows that Ram's character is not the right choice for an ideal leader. Such a leader cannot unite the community. Such leaders will not be able to unite people. It is a wrong approach.</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"the-brotherhood-and-its-consequences\">The Brotherhood and Its Consequences</h2>\n\n    <p>The text says the emphasis on brotherhood and its consequences. In Ramraj, it is suggested that only those who have a connection with Ram will get any benefit. This does not include democracy.</p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"the-promotion-of-brotherhood\">The Promotion of Brotherhood</h3>\n\n    <p>The promotion of brotherhood. The text shows how those close to the leader of Ram are given more power. The point is to show how those that are part of this ideology or connected to this leader will benefit. The text shows how democracy is not being supported. The emphasis is that only the family of the leader will be the beneficiaries. Those that are not part of this particular ideology will be excluded.</p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"the-role-of-the-brahmanical-system\">The Role of the Brahmanical System</h3>\n\n    <p>The Brahmanical system played a role. It also says that these systems do not focus on equality. It also promotes discrimination.</p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"the-implications-for-the-masses\">The Implications for the Masses</h3>\n\n    <p>The masses are not getting anything. They are the ones that are excluded from getting power. The entire society is impacted. The masses or common people are not benefiting.</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"the-historical-perspective-on-violence-and-its-effects\">The Historical Perspective on Violence and Its Effects</h2>\n\n    <p>It has been said that the narrative is that those people do not attack. This story presented in the Ramayana shows that they actually do and are always ready to attack.</p>\n\n    <p><img src=\"[insert image here - 01:27:36]\" alt=\"\" /></p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"the-prevalence-of-violence\">The Prevalence of Violence</h3>\n\n    <p>History shows that in the Ramayana, the leader is seen to be very happy. Ram's character is seen to be happy about killing people. The story tells of violence from both sides. In the story of the Ramayana, there are examples of murder, blood, and violence.</p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"the-impact-of-this-ideology\">The Impact of this Ideology</h3>\n\n    <p>The Ramayana's ideology does not have any humanity. The character of Ram is being presented as a person who does not care about women. This can result in a situation where women are also ill-treated in the future. The main issue is that, in this ideology, if there is a brother, he is against his brother. The point of the story is showing how one brother is against another.</p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"the-role-of-the-brahmanical-system-and-its-impact\">The Role of the Brahmanical System and Its Impact</h3>\n\n    <p>It also shows how those who are following this ideology must be followers of the Brahmanical system. The whole system and the leader is the Brahmanical system.</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"re-evaluating-ideologies-for-a-unified-future\">Re-evaluating Ideologies for a Unified Future</h2>\n\n    <p>There is a need to re-evaluate the existing ideologies to foster a sense of unity. The question has been raised as to whether a society should be built on these types of views or other beliefs.</p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"the-need-for-critical-examination\">The Need for Critical Examination</h3>\n\n    <p>It is necessary to critically examine. It is important to look at the evidence and the source of the story. It also is important to examine the basis of these ideas. If a person is a part of an ideology, then they should try to understand it.</p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"embracing-different-ideologies\">Embracing Different Ideologies</h3>\n\n    <p>Different ideologies should be accepted. The goal is to create a space where people with various beliefs can discuss openly and challenge each other with proofs. It is also stated that the goal of different religions is to unite.</p>\n\n    <h3 id=\"the-path-to-unity\">The Path to Unity</h3>\n\n    <p>People will accept a diversity of thoughts. The key is to have the ability to learn and grow from many different perspectives. A call was made that all people come together.</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"conclusion-what-you-can-do\">Conclusion: What Can You Do to Foster Unity?</h2>\n\n    <p>The path to a more united India lies in critical thinking and open dialogue. Recognize that narratives, especially those used to divide, must be examined with scrutiny. Question the past, seek diverse perspectives, and challenge the stories that may be contributing to disunity. Consider these actions:</p>\n\n    <ul>\n        <li>**Educate Yourself**: Learn about diverse perspectives and historical narratives beyond the mainstream.</li>\n        <li>**Engage in Dialogue**: Participate in respectful discussions with people who hold different views.</li>\n        <li>**Support Critical Analysis**: Encourage and share content that critically examines historical and ideological narratives.</li>\n        <li>**Promote Inclusivity**: Advocate for policies and practices that promote equality and respect for all communities.</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>By actively participating in re-evaluating the narratives that shape our society, we can work towards a more united future for India.</p>\n\n    <h2 id=\"disclaimer\">Disclaimer</h2>\n    <p>This article is based on the provided text and does not represent the author's personal opinions or beliefs.
