**Title:** Ancient Hindu Texts: The Real Science is in the Sexcapades! ü§Ø (NSFW-ish)

**Body:**

Okay, folks, let's talk "ancient science." You know, the kind where they claim India had flying cars and atomic bombs millennia ago? ü§î Well, I stumbled upon this article that dives deep into the *real* scientific breakthroughs detailed in Hindu texts, and let me tell you, it's wilder than your uncle's conspiracy theories.

Forget test-tube babies, these guys were inventing babies in *ghee-filled pots*! üè∫ Apparently, King Sagara's wife popped out a gourd that magically split into 60,000 sons. I'm no biologist, but something tells me that's not how reproduction works.

But wait, there's more! Did you know the god Brahma got so turned on by Parvati's *thumb* that he ejaculated into his own lap, birthing an army of celibate monks? üò≥ And Krishna? Let's just say he had a "divine discharge" during a divine assembly that resulted in... well, you'll have to read the article to believe it.

Seriously, the birth stories in these texts are less about science and more about... well, let's just say they're creative.

Is this the advanced science our ancestors were hiding? Or is it just a bunch of dudes writing fanfiction thousands of years ago?

*   "So, Brahma's basically the OG self-pleasuring deity? ü§£"
*   "Is it just me, or are these stories kind of... problematic? ü§î"
*   "Maybe 'ancient science' is just a euphemism for 'really, really bad storytelling.'"
*   "I bet the patriarchy had something to do with these stories."
