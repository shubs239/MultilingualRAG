**Title:** Ayurveda: Not so 'holistic' after all? 🤔

**Body:**

Guys, I came across this eye-opening piece that really challenges the popular image of Ayurveda. Did you know that ancient Ayurvedic texts like Charaka Samhita actually recommend *meat-based diets* for some conditions?😳 Like, they suggest consuming meat for patients with diabetes!

Also, there's mention of Goumutra (cow urine) being used in treatments. Seriously? I always thought Ayurveda was all about vegetarianism and natural remedies.

The article also points out potential issues with caste biases influencing practices and a lack of solid scientific evidence. Is this ancient wisdom, or outdated tradition?

I am shooketh. Is Ayurveda really as harmless and 'natural' as we think?

**Explanation of Choices:**

*   **Reddit:** I've framed the post to be conversational and questioning. I've highlighted the most potentially controversial points (meat consumption, cow urine) to grab attention and spark debate. The call to action is direct: read the article and share your opinions.
*   **X:** The X posts are short, punchy, and use strong language ("shocking," "ethical red flags") to pique interest. Hashtags are relevant and designed to increase visibility.
*   **Tone:** Both posts aim to sound like a real person sharing something they found interesting and slightly disturbing, rather than a formal announcement.

**Important Notes:**

*   **Sensitivity:** Be prepared for strong reactions and potential backlash, especially on X. Ayurveda is a sensitive topic for many.
*   **Engagement:** Be active in the comments sections on both platforms to further fuel the discussion (and defend your post, if needed).
*   **Adaptation:** Monitor the responses and tweak your messaging in future posts based on what resonates most.
