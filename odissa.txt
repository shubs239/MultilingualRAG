    <h2>Introduction: Odisha's Buddhist Legacy and the Suppression of History</h2>
    <p>For centuries, Odisha has been known for its vibrant cultural heritage, often associated with Hinduism, particularly the Jagannath Temple in Puri.

    <h2>The Pioneering Work of Alexander Cunningham</h2>
    <h3>Cunningham's Explorations in Odisha</h3>
    <p>Alexander Cunningham, the father of Indian archaeology, played a pivotal role in documenting India's historical sites. His comprehensive work in Odisha provides invaluable insights into the state's Buddhist past [insert image here -time in min]. Cunningham's meticulous records and surveys offer a foundation for understanding the region's early Buddhist influence.
    </p>
    <h3>Key Observations from Cunningham's Texts</h3>
    <p>Cunningham's writings detail the presence of Buddhist monuments and relics throughout Odisha. He noted that ancient Odisha, known then as "Dra," had a periphery of approximately 1,167 miles and was bordered by the sea in the southeast. This region was home to a prominent port called "Charitrapur," likely the present-day Puri. [insert image here -time in min]
    </p>
    <h3>Connecting Stupas to Jagannath</h3>
    <p>Cunningham highlighted the existence of five stupas near the city, suggesting that one of these stupas was likely repurposed and dedicated to Jagannath. He further observed that the deity, along with his siblings Baladeva and Subhadra, were represented by three "formless" ( आकार रहित ) images, reminiscent of the Buddhist symbols of Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha [insert image here -time in min].

    <h2>The Accounts of Xuanzang (Hiuen Tsang)</h2>
    <h3>Xuanzang's 7th-Century Visit</h3>
    <p>The Chinese traveler Xuanzang, also known as Hiuen Tsang, visited Odisha in the 7th century CE. His detailed accounts provide a contemporary perspective on the region's religious landscape, offering valuable information about the prevalence of Buddhism and other religious practices during that era.
    </p>
    <h3>Odisha as a Flourishing Buddhist Center</h3>
     <p>Xuanzang noted that the land was fertile and productive, yielding abundant harvests. While mentioning that the people were uncivilized, he added that they loved learning, and most of them followed Buddhism. He documented the existence of over 100 monasteries with more than 10,000 monks who practiced Mahayana Buddhism [insert image here -time in min].
    </p>
    <h3>The Presence of Stupas and Opposition</h3>
    <p>Xuanzang also mentioned the presence of about 10 stupas built by Emperor Ashoka, marking places where Buddha had preached. Additionally, he noted the existence of 50 Deva temples where various opposing views resided, indicating a complex religious environment ([insert image here -time in min]. This suggests that Buddhism coexisted with other traditions, although it was the dominant religion in the region at that time.</p>

    <h2>Insights from Buddhist Literature</h2>
    <h3>Lalitavistara Sutra</h3>
    <p>In the Buddhist text ललितविस्तरसूत्र  Lalitavistara Sutra, is a list of script name called Bramhi [insert image here -time in min].
    <h3>Avadanasataka</h3>
    <p>The Avadanasataka, a collection of Buddhist narratives, provides glimpses into the social and religious life of ancient India. These stories often feature stupas and other Buddhist sites, offering insights into the practices and beliefs of the time.
    </p>

    <h2>The Archaeological Landscape of Odisha</h2>
    <h3>Udayagiri and Khandagiri Caves</h3>
    <p>The Udayagiri and Khandagiri caves near Bhubaneswar are prime examples of ancient rock-cut architecture with Buddhist and Jain influences. These caves, dating back to the 2nd century BCE, feature inscriptions and carvings that reflect the religious syncretism of the time [insert image here -time in min].
    </p>
    <h3>Ratnagiri, Lalitgiri, and Pushpagiri</h3>
    <p>The archaeological sites of Ratnagiri, Lalitgiri, and Pushpagiri reveal the presence of ancient Buddhist monastic complexes. Excavations have unearthed stupas, sculptures, and other artifacts that attest to the region's vibrant Buddhist heritage. Pushpagiri, mentioned by Xuanzang, was a significant center of Buddhist learning [ref].

    <h2>Connecting Jagannath to Buddhism</h2>
    <h3>An Interpretation Rooted in Buddhist Philosophy</h3>
     <p>Alexander Cunningham proposed that the deities Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subhadra are symbolic representations of the Buddhist principles of Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. These deities are venerated at the Jagannath Temple in Puri. The images of the three deities at the Jagannath Temple – Jagannath, Balabhadra and Subhadra – do not resemble any known Hindu deities. Their abstract, geometric forms are a puzzle that has intrigued scholars and devotees alike [insert image here -time in min].
    </p>
    <h3>The Absence of the Jagannath Temple in Xuanzang's Records</h3>
    <p>Remarkably, Xuanzang, despite his detailed documentation of the region, made no mention of the Jagannath Temple. This suggests that the temple either did not exist during his visit or was not as prominent as other Buddhist sites. It is believed that after Ven Sang’s visit there were no remains there and it was built around Ven Sang period[insert image here -time in min].
    </p>
    <h3>Panch Raksha Stupas and the Emergence of Jagannath</h3>
    <p>Cunningham suggested that the current Jagannath Temple might have been built on the site of one of the five ancient stupas located near Puri. These stupas, with their towering structures, were likely significant Buddhist monuments that were later adapted into Hindu places of worship.

    <h2>The Hinduization of Buddhist Sites</h2>
    <h3>Vandalization of Monuments</h3>
    <p>The appropriation of Buddhist sites by Hindus often involved the destruction or alteration of Buddhist monuments. Stupas were converted into temples, and Buddhist sculptures were replaced with Hindu deities. There were efforts made to vandalize the scultures [insert image here -time in min].
    </p>
    <h3>Rewriting History</h3>
    <p>Along with physical alterations, historical narratives were rewritten to erase or downplay Buddhist influences. Local legends and traditions were modified to align with Hindu beliefs, effectively creating a new religious identity for the region. A clear case was seen in Kharavela where it was claimed that he was jainism to hide that place from the world[insert image here -time in min].
    </p>

    <h2>Testimonials from Hindu Leaders</h2>
    <h3>Swami Vivekananda's Acknowledgment</h3>
     <p>Even some Hindu leaders have acknowledged the Buddhist origins of certain Hindu sites. Swami Vivekananda, in his complete biography, stated that the Jagannath Temple was originally a Buddhist temple that was later taken over and re-Hinduized. This admission from a prominent Hindu figure lends further credence to the Buddhist past of Odisha [insert image here -time in min].
