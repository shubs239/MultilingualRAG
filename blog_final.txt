<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>

<p>Prayag, now officially known as Prayagraj, holds a significant place in Indian history and spirituality. While often associated with the confluence of the Ganga, Yamuna, and mythical Saraswati rivers and Hindu traditions, its rich Buddhist past remains largely unexplored. This article aims to shed light on this hidden history, drawing upon the accounts of ancient travelers and archaeological evidence. [insert image here - 53.68] By examining these sources, we can challenge prevailing narratives and reclaim the region's true heritage, revealing its deep connections to Buddhist traditions and figures like Emperor Ashoka. </p>

<h2 id="travelers-accounts">Travelers' Accounts of Prayag</h2>

<p>Ancient travelers to India left behind invaluable records of their journeys, providing glimpses into the social, religious, and political landscape of the time. These accounts offer crucial insights into Prayag's history and its connections to Buddhism. We will examine the writings of prominent figures such as Hiuen Tsang ( वेन सांग ) and the observations of Alexander Cunningham, who meticulously documented their experiences and findings in the region. [insert image here - 95.479] Their records provide a counter-narrative to the often-dominant Brahminical perspective, revealing a vibrant Buddhist presence in Prayag and its surrounding areas. Furthermore, their accounts offer tangible evidence of the region's diverse religious landscape.</p>

<h2 id="alexander-cunningham">Alexander Cunningham's Insights</h2>

<p>Alexander Cunningham, a renowned archaeologist and historian, played a pivotal role in uncovering India's ancient past. His work, particularly his surveys and excavations, brought to light numerous Buddhist sites and artifacts. In the context of Prayag, Cunningham's records offer valuable information about the region's Buddhist heritage, including the presence of monasteries, stupas, and other religious structures. [insert image here - 123.68] He cross-referenced various sources, including the accounts of Hiuen Tsang, to create a comprehensive picture of Prayag's history. Cunningham's meticulous documentation and analysis provide a solid foundation for understanding the region's Buddhist connections. Indeed, his work remains essential for modern researchers.</p>

<h2 id="hiuen-tsang">Hiuen Tsang's Journey and Observations</h2>

<p>Hiuen Tsang ( वेन सांग ), a 7th-century Chinese Buddhist monk, embarked on a pilgrimage to India to collect Buddhist scriptures and learn from the great masters of the time. His detailed travelogue, the "Great Tang Records on the Western Regions," offers a wealth of information about the places he visited, including Prayag. Hiuen Tsang's account describes the presence of Buddhist monasteries, monks, and religious practices in the region. [insert image here - 161.959] He also mentions the existence of other religious traditions, providing a nuanced picture of Prayag's religious landscape. Hiuen Tsang's journey and observations serve as a crucial primary source for understanding the region's Buddhist history. </p>

<h2 id="akbar-allahabad">Akbar's Fort and the Naming of Allahabad</h2>

<p>During the Mughal era, Prayag underwent significant changes, including the construction of a fort by Emperor Akbar. This fort, strategically located at the confluence of the rivers, became a symbol of Mughal power in the region. [insert image here - 197.56] It was Akbar's grandson, Shah Jahan, who renamed Prayag to Allahabad. While these events are well-documented, it is essential to consider the historical context and the region's pre-existing Buddhist heritage. The construction of the fort and the renaming of the city do not erase the earlier Buddhist presence, but rather represent a layer of history that needs to be understood in relation to the region's deeper past. However, the name change marked a shift in the region's cultural landscape.</p>

<h2 id="brahminical-narratives">Challenging Brahminical Narratives</h2>

<p>The prevailing narratives surrounding Prayag often emphasize its significance in Hindu mythology and Brahminical traditions. However, these narratives tend to overshadow the region's Buddhist history and the contributions of Buddhist figures. It is crucial to critically examine these narratives and challenge their dominance by presenting alternative perspectives based on historical evidence and traveler's accounts. By questioning the Brahminical claims and highlighting the Buddhist connections, we can create a more balanced and accurate understanding of Prayag's past. [insert image here - 257.32] The stories of the banyan tree and Prayag being named after a Brahmin are false stories used to obfuscate the true history. Stories like these should not be believed.</p>

<h2 id="the-name-prayag">The Origin of the Name "Prayag"</h2>

<p>The origin of the name "Prayag" itself is a subject of debate, with various theories proposed. One popular narrative claims that the name is derived from a Brahmin who sacrificed himself during the construction of Akbar's fort. However, this narrative is contested by historical evidence and the accounts of ancient travelers. By examining these alternative perspectives, we can gain a more accurate understanding of the name's etymology and its potential connections to Buddhist traditions.</p>

<h3 id="the-story-of-the-brahmin">The Story of the Brahmin Sacrifice</h3>

<p>According to a widely circulated story, the name "Prayag" is derived from a Brahmin who volunteered to be sacrificed to ensure the stability of Akbar's fort during its construction. It was said that the fort walls kept collapsing until a human sacrifice was offered. The legend states that a Brahmin named Prayag offered his life on the condition that the fort be named after him. [insert image here - 328.56] This story, often presented as historical fact, lacks credible evidence and appears to be a later fabrication aimed at legitimizing Brahminical claims to the region.</p>

<h3 id="cunningham-refutation">Cunningham's Refutation of the Brahminical Claim</h3>

<p>Alexander Cunningham, known for his meticulous research and critical analysis, dismissed the Brahminical narrative surrounding the name "Prayag." He argued that the story was a fabrication created during the British period to promote Brahminical influence in the region. Cunningham pointed out that the name "Prayag" predates Akbar's reign and can be traced back to earlier Buddhist sources, including the accounts of Hiuen Tsang. [insert image here - 384.24] He emphasized the importance of relying on credible historical evidence rather than unsubstantiated legends. To start, he focused on primary sources.</p>

<h3 id="hiuen-tsangs-mention">Hiuen Tsang's Mention of Prayag</h3>

<p>Hiuen Tsang ( वेन सांग ), the 7th-century Chinese Buddhist monk, mentioned the name "Prayag" in his travelogue, indicating that the name existed long before Akbar's fort was built. This evidence contradicts the Brahminical narrative that attributes the name's origin to a Brahmin sacrifice during the Mughal era. [insert image here - 423.68] Hiuen Tsang's account suggests that the name "Prayag" may have deeper roots in the region's Buddhist past, potentially dating back to the time of Emperor Ashoka.</p>

<h2 id="the-temple-confusion">The Temple Confusion: Buddhist or Brahminical?</h2>

<p>Accounts describe a temple near the junction of two rivers. However, translator errors have lead to confusion. The accurate meaning and origin of this temple needs careful consideration to distinguish a Buddhist or Brahmincal origin. The following information goes into the context of the references. Translation confusions are like a game of telephone; the original message gets distorted as it passes through different interpreters.</p>
   
<h3 id="vensang-records">Ven Sang's Records</h3>
<p>Ven Sang's descriptions were mistranslated. The word for Brahmin has an alternative meaning in Buddhism which was the intended meaning.[insert image here - 689.279]</p>

<h3 id="Buddhist-context">The Buddhist Context of "Brahman"</h3>
<p>In Ven Sang's writings, the word Brahmana is used to describe someone from Buddhism. Not someone from Vedicism. This important destinction clears up much confusion about the nature of the temple.[insert image here - 712.24]</p>

<h3 id="the-banyan-tree">The Banyan Tree and the Cannibal Demon</h3>
<p>Ancient Buddhist temples often have Banyan trees nearby. The demon description is part of a propagnda campaign in which it was said that a cannibal demon resided under the tree. These are common themes in which Buddhist temples are described.[insert image here - 740.519]</p>

<h2 id="ashoka-pillar">Ashoka's Pillar and Buddhist Influence</h2>

<p>Near the temple was a giant stupa that predates the temple. At 100 feet tall, it was ordered by Emperor Ashoka. This shows the land was Buddhist from the start. Any conflicting stories are fabrications.</p>

<h3 id="dev-bodhisattva">Deva Bodhisattva's Role</h3>
<p>Deva's book refuted Theravada's teachings, which show that any opposing forces came from this other brand of Buddhism and that the temple itself must have been Mahayana.[insert image here - 1471.679]</p>

<h3 id="defeat-of-opponents">Defeat of Opponents</h3>
<p>A place where the Buddah defeated his opponents. Which further shows it was not a Vedic place.[insert image here - 1347.88]</p>

<h3 id="stupa-Details">Stupa Details</h3>
<p>Another nearby stupa had hair and nails from Buddhas. Indicating its historical important to the religion.[insert image here - 1429.64]</p>

<h2 id="harshvardhan-buddhism">Harshavardhana's Buddhist Devotion</h2>

<p>Travelers made it clear that every 5 years the ruler at the time would adorn a Buddah and then donate riches to the local monks. As well as to the poor and other religions. This tradition made no mention of hindu gods and was in line with what we would expect from a Buddhist. Furthermore, his lifestyle of being vegetarian, showed how highly Buddism influenced his life.[insert image here - 2314.599]</p>
