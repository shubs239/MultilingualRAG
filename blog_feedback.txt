One such obscured chapter involves the profound Buddhist heritage of numerous Indian states, including Orissa (now Odisha). Archaeological discoveries and historical accounts reveal that many regions, now associated with other faiths, were once thriving Buddhist centers. This exploration focuses on Orissa, examining the evidence that points to its significant Buddhist past and challenging the dominant historical narrative. Understanding this suppressed history is vital for comprehending the complexities of Indian society and addressing contemporary issues.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"alexander-cunningham\">Alexander Cunningham and Orissa's Buddhist Identity</h2>\n<p>Alexander Cunningham, a renowned archaeologist, made significant contributions to understanding India's Buddhist past. His extensive work across Orissa detailed the region's historical connection to Buddhism. Let's delve into his observations and insights.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"cunningham-view\">Cunningham's Perspective on Puri and Jagannath</h3>\n<p>Cunningham's research shed light on the historical significance of places like Puri and the Jagannath Temple. He noted that the area, originally known as Charitrapur, was a prominent port. [insert image here - 201]This port's proximity to the Jagannath Temple is crucial. </p>\n\n<h3 id=\"stupa-jagannath\">The Stupa and Jagannath</h3>\n<p>Cunningham proposed that the Jagannath Temple might have evolved from one of five stupas located outside the city. [insert image here - 361]He suggested that one of these stupas, distinguished by its towering height, was adapted and dedicated to Jagannath. This assertion implies a transformation of Buddhist structures into what is now a major Hindu pilgrimage site.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"idol-symbolism\">Idol Symbolism: Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha</h3>\n<p>Cunningham drew attention to the three \"formless\" idols within the Jagannath Temple â€“ Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subhadra. He argued that these figures are symbolic representations of the Buddhist concepts of Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. [insert image here - 417]He noted that these idols are a direct imitation of the Buddhist trinity, further solidifying the Buddhist origins of the temple. <br><b>Source:</b> Alexander Cunningham's book available in Hindi translation.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"historical-sources\">Historical Sources: Validating Buddhist Origins</h2>\n<p>Beyond archaeological findings, historical texts provide additional validation of Orissa's Buddhist past. Let's explore these sources.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"banaras-mathura\">The Pundits of Banaras and Mathura</h3>\n<p>Seeking to understand the deities of Jagannath, Balabhadra, and Subhadra, Cunningham consulted with pundits from Banaras and Mathura, prominent centers of Hindu learning. The response he received was revealing: these figures were recognized as Brahminical incarnations of the Buddha. [insert image here - 561]This acknowledgement from within the Hindu tradition reinforces the Buddhist roots of the Jagannath Temple. <br><b>Source:</b> Alexander Cunningham's book available in Hindi translation.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"sanchi-excavations\">Sanchi Excavations</h3>\n<p>Cunningham's excavations at Sanchi, a significant Buddhist site, yielded further evidence. The findings there mirrored the three symbolic figures found at the Jagannath Temple, representing Buddha, Dharma, and Sangha. [insert image here - 810] This parallel suggests a common Buddhist influence across different regions of India. <br><b>Source:</b>  'Buddhist Monuments of Central India' by Alexander Cunningham.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"vivenkananda-views\">Views of Vivekananda</h2>\n<p>Even Swami Vivekananda, a prominent Hindu figure, acknowledged the Buddhist origins of the Jagannath Temple. In his complete biography, Vivekananda wrote, \"The Temple of Jagannath is an old Buddhist Temple.\" He further noted the process of re-Hinduizing Buddhist sites, [insert image here - 953] revealing an awareness of the historical transformation of religious spaces. <br><b>Source:</b> Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda, Volume 3.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"wen-tsong-account\">Unveiling Orissa Through the Eyes of Wen Tsong</h2>\n<p>To gain a comprehensive understanding of Orissa's past, let's turn to the account of the Chinese traveler and scholar, Wen Tsong (also known as Xuanzang), who visited the region in the 7th century CE.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"wen-tsong-insights\">Wen Tsong's Insights on Orissa</h3>\n<p>Wen Tsong's writings offer valuable insights into the socio-cultural and religious landscape of Orissa during his time. He described the land as fertile and prosperous, abundant in fruits and resources. He also noted the physical characteristics of the people and their distinct language. However, his most significant observations concern the religious affiliations of the population.</p>\n\n<h3 id=\"buddhist-inclination\">Buddhist Inclination</h3>\n<p>Wen Tsong explicitly stated that the majority of the population in Orissa were ardent followers of Buddhism. [insert image here - 1169]He documented the presence of over 100 monasteries, housing thousands of monks who practiced Mahayana Buddhism. While also mentioning 50 Deva temples, but also hinted towards the presence of independent or ajivika thinkers.  <br><b>Source:</b> Si-Yu-Ki: Buddhist Records of the Western World, translated by Samuel Beal.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"puspagiri-connection\">The Pushpagiri Connection</h2>\n<p>Wen Tsong's travels led him to Pushpagiri, a significant Buddhist site located on a large mountain on the southwestern frontier of the country. [insert image here - 1484]He described a stone stupa at Pushpagiri that emitted a spiritual radiance, attracting religious pilgrims from distant lands. He said the lighting on uposatha day is a great sight to see<br><b>Source:</b> Si-Yu-Ki: Buddhist Records of the Western World, translated by Samuel Beal.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"udayagiri-khandagiri\">Udayagiri and Khandagiri: Ancient Buddhist Sites</h2>\n<p>Further solidifying Orissa's Buddhist past, Wen Tsong identified the hills of Udayagiri and Khandagiri as significant Buddhist centers. These hills, located near Cuttack and Bhubaneswar, housed numerous caves adorned with Buddhist inscriptions and sculptures. [insert image here - 1587]These sites served as monastic complexes, providing refuge and learning centers for Buddhist monks and scholars. <br><b>Source:</b> Si-Yu-Ki: Buddhist Records of the Western World, translated by Samuel Beal.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"site-preservation\">Preservation of Buddhis sites</h2>\n<p>It is important to recognize and consider this a political agenda and how their original versions were altered to fit the current needs.</p>\n<h2 id=\"the-nagar-puri\">The Port Nagar Puri:</h2>\n<p>It was a port located near Sinhala is 20000 le away. During the time people in Sri Lanka used to think that on a clear day the stupas were visible. <br><b>Source:</b> Si-Yu-Ki: Buddhist Records of the Western World, translated by Samuel Beal.</p>\n\n\n<h2 id=\"conclusion\">Conclusion</h2>\n<p>The evidence presented throughout this exploration paints a compelling picture of Orissa's rich Buddhist heritage. Archaeological findings, historical accounts, and scholarly interpretations converge to reveal a region deeply rooted in Buddhist traditions. From the potential Buddhist origins of the Jagannath Temple to the vibrant monastic centers of Pushpagiri, Udayagiri, and Khandagiri, Orissa's past is inextricably linked to Buddhism. It is crucial to acknowledge and understand this suppressed history to foster a more inclusive and accurate understanding of India's cultural and religious landscape.</p>\n\n<p><b>Call to Action:</b> Share this article to spread awareness about Orissa's Buddhist past.
